The Terms and Conditions prevail to the extent of any inconsistency with the terms and conditions of any document issued by You (whether before or after the date of any agreement between You and Us).

					<h3>Fees payable to MFDC (2)</h3>
					<p>Fees payable to Us will be calculated according to the Quoted Estimate and Scope Documents as agreed between the customer and by Us for Our services. Those rates will vary based on the type of services rendered, which may include without limitation graphic design services, print design services, web design services, creative services, information technology services, provision of and configuration of hardware and/or software, consulting services and strategic services. We will endeavor to provide you with an estimate of fees to be charged for particular stages of work (whether a quoted estimate, estimate or summary of costs in relation to a proof of concept). No such estimate will be a quotation. Unless agreed otherwise in writing, the fees payable to Us will depend on the actual time spent on your work. Without limiting the foregoing, any estimate given by Us will cease to be valid if not accepted within 14 days of the date of the estimate, unless expressly stated to the contrary.</p>
					<p>All disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Us in connection with the relevant work are added to the fees payable by MFDC and must be paid by You. Without limiting the foregoing, any estimates provided by Us for any stage of work may, unless expressly stated to the contrary, include an estimate of any reasonably foreseeable disbursements and expenses.

All remaining costs are payable to Us within 14 days from the date of the invoice being issued to You. A payment schedule will outline the structure of fees payable throughout the project stages and will be finalised in the Scope document.</p>
					<p>Payment terms are strictly 14 days from date of invoice being issued. We are entitled to make written demand for any amounts outstanding and interest is payable by You from the date of demand on any amounts outstanding payable at the rate prescribed in accordance with section 59 of the <I>Civil Proceedings Act 2011 </I>(Qld).You will reimburse Us any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by us in seeking to recover outstanding amounts due to Us, including but not limited to debt collection fees, legal fees and expenses.</p>
					<p>Any estimate, or quotation provide by Us is exclusive of GST, unless specifically expressed to be inclusive of GST. If any supply made by Us attracts GST, You are responsible for also paying Us the GST amount.</p>
					<p>Without limiting the forgoing, additional charges may apply in excess of any estimate, quote or invoice in circumstances where You request Us to provide goods and/or services on an urgent basis or otherwise within a shorter time frame than that previously agreed.</p>
					<h3>Debt Recovery (3)</h3>
					<p>If Fees Payable to MFDC (2) are not made in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, MFDC will engage the services of a debt recovery agency and all fees and charges with regards to debt recovery and the debt recovery agency will be at the expense of the Customer and will be added to the total fees and charges outstanding.</p>

					<p>You must do all things reasonably necessary, and supply Us in a timely fashion with all materials reasonably required by Us, in order for Us to perform the services. This may include without limitation supplying copy, photographs and other visual or audio-visual material, and if required, performing sub-editing and copywriting. Without limiting Our rights under this agreement, if We are unable to complete any services because of Your actions or omissions, or if You instruct Us to cease or postpone any work, We may still render invoices for time expended or work already performed, including any disbursements incurred or agreed to by Us or any other Third Party.</p>
					<p>You warrant that you are entitled to use, and to authorise Us to use, all visual elements, written expressions, trade marks and other components and content that You provide to Us. You are solely responsible for obtaining any permission associated with the use of such materials.
